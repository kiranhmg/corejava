1) java:java is a tool provided by jdk.it is used to interpret program.
   javac:javac is a compiler it is used to convert source code to bite code.

2)jdk: jdk stands for java development kit.
        it is used to writeing and executing programs.
        it contains tools and jre.
  jre:java run time environment.
        it is used to executing programs.
       it contains libraries and jvm.
  jvm:java virtual machine.
       it does exist physically,jvm is used for execution of programms.
3) .java File: it is a source code present in common language.

   .class: it containce byte code ,it is created after compileing source clode.

4) 1.jdk
   2.jvm
   3.jre

5) variable: variable is container to store information,it will point to memory location.
    there are are 2 types of variable:
     1)class level:
             in class level there are 2 types:
              1)static variable  ex:static int num;

              2)non static variable ex: int num;
     2) methode level:
                in class level there are 2 types:
              1)local variable ex:{
                                     int num;

                                    }

              2)parameterized variable ex:  void name(String name)

7) program will executed but no messages

8)data type:
              data type represent different size and value stored in variable.
      there are 2 types in data type:
              1) primitive  ex:
                                 int num;
              2) non primitive   ex:
                                        Shape shape;
9)Dot operator:
               dot operator is used to access properties and methode of class.
               Ex:Shape.name

10) Features of java:
     object oriented
     multi thread
     plotform independece
     security
     robust
     automatic garbage collection
     
11) array:
             array is a collection of similar data type elements.
             array is fixed size
             elements of array can be accessed using index
             we can create array using new key word:ex: int[] num=new int[];
                                                    
            there are 2 types of array:
               1) single line array
               2) multidimentional array
             Ex: int[] num={1,2,3}

12) class: class is a blue print to create object 
           class is a key word.
           Ex: class movie{

                     }

    object: object is real world entity,object is a instance of class having states and behaviour
                   Movie movie=new Movie();

13)  key words:
          key words are reserved words
          key words can not be used as variable or method name

          Ex:
               if,for,while,class,int,return,break,switch,else,double.

14)  constructor:
                 constructor is a special method
                 constructor has same name as class name.
                 it is used to initialize the instance variable
                 constructor has no return type
                 There are 2 types of constructor:
                 1)default constructor
                 2)parameterized constructor

15)  main method is static because jvm starts its execution from manin method with out creating instance of class

16)   class Example
         {
               public static void main(String[] any)
              {
                  int[] num={12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
                  int n=num.length;
                   System.out.println(n+" length of array present in given list");
                 }
           }

17)  method:
              method is collection of statements that are executed when we invoke the method
               Ex: void name(String movie)
                    {
                       System.out.println("movie is:"+movie);
                    }

     method overloading: two or method having same name but different number of parameter is called method overloading.
                           Ex:   void movie(String name)
                                 {
                                      System.out.println("name is:"+name);
                                  }
                                   void movie(String name,String theater)
                                 {
                                      System.out.println("name is:"+name);
                                      System.out.println("theater is :"+theater);

                                  }
